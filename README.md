### Methods and Tools
* Data Cleaning (Excel, SQL Server)
* Data Visualisation (Power BI)

### Insights and Findings
* Customer Gender Distribution: Total customer strength is 10,999; 5454 (male) and 5545 (female).
* Shipments Insights: 10,999 shipments were completed;
  * Via Ship - 7,462 (4,459 - Not on time, 3003 - On time)
  * Via Flight - 1777 (1069 - Not on time, 708 - On time)
  * Via Road - 1760 (1035 - Not on time, 725 - On time)
627 high, 3233 medium and 3602 low importance goods were transported via Ship.
* Delivery Time: From the total shipments made, 4,436 were delivered on time (40.3%) and 6,563 were delivered late (59.7%).

### Conclusion
Female customers, comprising 50.4% made up the higher percentage of the customer base. Ship was the most common means of shipment. Shipments were delivered late regardless of the mode of shipment used. Shipments via Road and Flight need to be bolstered as the margin of 'On time' deliveries when compared to shipments via Ship.

### Recommendations
Customers should be encouraged to use other shipment methods to even out the workload. Discounts are good incentives and should be continued.
